# Cloud-Native E-Commerce Migration Patterns


# Repository Purpose

This repository provides ready-to-use solutions for migrating legacy e-commerce applications to cloud-native architectures, 
It demonstrates practical implementation patterns, focusing on AWS services with a cloud-agnostic approach when possible.



# Why Cloud-Native?
E-commerce businesses, whether small, mid-sized, or large, face distinct challenges:

**Small Businesses**: High costs and resource demands of SaaS/PaaS solutions like SAP Commerce Cloud.
**Mid-Sized Businesses**: Balancing customization, integration, and cost-performance trade-offs.
**Large Enterprises**: Complexity in scaling, global rollouts, and maintaining integrations.

Cloud-native architectures enable:
Reduced vendor lock-in
Improved scalability and high availability
Faster innovation and time-to-market
Optimized costs




# Patterns for Migration
Migrating legacy e-commerce systems to cloud-native solutions requires a systematic approach. 
The following proven migration patterns are used to transition legacy systems to cloud-native solutions:

**Strangler**: Gradually replace components of the legacy system with cloud-native services.
Best For: Minimizing risk during migration.
**Lift and Shift**: Move the application to the cloud with minimal changes.
Best For: Quick migration when immediate benefits are required.
**Re-platform**: Optimize parts of the system to leverage cloud services.
Best For: Minor optimizations without full re-architecture.
**Re-factor**: Reorganize the application to improve performance and cloud compatibility.
Best For: Applications requiring performance improvements.
**Re-architect**: Fully redesign the application for cloud-native benefits.
Best For: Applications with extensive scalability and flexibility needs.
**Re-build**: Recreate the application from scratch with cloud-native principles.
Best For: Legacy systems too rigid for other approaches.





# Planned Projects
Each project includes:
Architecture diagrams
Terraform scripts (where applicable)
Demo code examples
AWS service usage examples


1. Event-Driven Architecture : 
   Decouple legacy monolithic applications using event-driven design.
   Example: Decoupling order processing and inventory management with Amazon SNS and SQS.
2. Microservices Decomposition :
   Break monolithic applications into smaller, independently deployable services.
   Example: Separating catalog, payment, and user services.
3. Serverless Migration :
   Migrate small parts of the application to serverless architecture.
   Example: Implementing serverless functions for order confirmations with AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
4. Containerization :
   Package applications using containers.
   Example: Running a product search service in Docker containers managed with ECS.
5. Kubernetes Orchestration :
   Use Kubernetes for deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
   Example: Deploying a recommendation engine using Kubernetes on EKS.
6. Service Mesh Implementation :
   Manage service-to-service communication in microservices.
   Example: Implement Istio for secure communication between services.
7. API Gateway Setup :
   Expose microservices securely to external clients.
   Example: Implementing a unified gateway for catalog, search, and payment services.
8. Observability and Monitoring :
   Monitor, trace, and debug applications effectively.
   Example: Using AWS CloudWatch, X-Ray, and Prometheus for full-stack observability.
9. Security Best Practices :
   Apply robust security measures in cloud environments.
   Example: Integrate AWS Cognito for authentication and S3 bucket policies for secure file storage.
10. CI/CD Pipelines :
    Automate application build, test, and deployment.
    Example: Setting up GitHub Actions with AWS CodePipeline for automated deployments.
