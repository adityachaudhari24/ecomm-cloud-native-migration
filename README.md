# Cloud-Native E-Commerce Migration Patterns


# Repository Purpose

This repository provides ready-to-use solutions for migrating legacy e-commerce applications to cloud-native architectures, 
It demonstrates practical implementation patterns, focusing on AWS services with a cloud-agnostic approach when possible.



# Why Cloud-Native?
E-commerce businesses, whether small, mid-sized, or large, face distinct challenges:

**Small Businesses**: High costs and resource demands of SaaS/PaaS.

**Mid-Sized Businesses**: Balancing customization, integration, and cost-performance trade-offs.

**Large Enterprises**: Complexity in scaling, global rollouts, and maintaining integrations.

Cloud-native architectures enable:
Reduced vendor lock-in
Improved scalability and high availability
Faster innovation and time-to-market
Optimized costs




# Patterns for Migration
Migrating legacy e-commerce systems to cloud-native solutions requires a systematic approach. 
The following proven migration patterns are used to transition legacy systems to cloud-native solutions:

**Strangler**: Gradually replace components of the legacy system with cloud-native services.
Best For: Minimizing risk during migration.

**Lift and Shift**: Move the application to the cloud with minimal changes.
Best For: Quick migration when immediate benefits are required.

**Re-platform**: Optimize parts of the system to leverage cloud services.
Best For: Minor optimizations without full re-architecture.

**Re-factor**: Reorganize the application to improve performance and cloud compatibility.
Best For: Applications requiring performance improvements.

**Re-architect**: Fully redesign the application for cloud-native benefits.
Best For: Applications with extensive scalability and flexibility needs.

**Re-build**: Recreate the application from scratch with cloud-native principles.
Best For: Legacy systems too rigid for other approaches.

Goal in this repository is to provide practical ready to use solutions which can be use as a reference for some part of any of the above migration patterns.

## Cloud-Native E-Commerce Use Cases

### 1. Event-Driven Order Processing
**Use Case:** Decouple order processing from the main application to improve scalability and fault tolerance.

**Scenario:**

When a customer places an order, the system publishes an event (OrderPlaced) to an event bus.
Downstream services (e.g., inventory management, shipping, and notifications) consume the event and process it independently.

**Solution:** \
AWS SNS: For event broadcasting. \
AWS SQS: For downstream service queuing. \
AWS Lambda: For serverless processing of order updates.

**Outcome:** \
Reduces coupling between services, enabling independent scaling and easier feature additions.

### 2. Dynamic Product Recommendation Engine
**Use Case:** \
Build a scalable, cloud-native product recommendation system to enhance user experience and boost sales.

**Scenario:** \
Analyze user browsing behavior to provide personalized product recommendations.\

**Solution:** \
AWS DynamoDB: To store user interaction data. \
Amazon SageMaker: For training and deploying machine learning models. \
AWS API Gateway: For real-time integration with the recommendation engine. \

**Outcome:**

### 3. Serverless Image Optimization for Product Media
**Use Case:** \
Optimize product images dynamically for better page load times on various devices.

**Scenario:** \
When a new product image is uploaded, create optimized versions (e.g., thumbnails, high-resolution) for different platforms.

**Solution:** \
Amazon S3: For storing original images and optimized versions.
AWS Lambda: Triggered on S3 upload to resize images using libraries like Sharp.
Amazon CloudFront: To serve images globally via a CDN.

**Outcome:** \
Enhances website performance and ensures consistent user experience across devices.

### 4. Real-Time Inventory Management System
**Use Case:** \
Migrate inventory tracking to a cloud-native architecture to support high-traffic events like flash sales.

**Scenario:** \
Ensure inventory levels are updated in real-time across all sales channels (website, mobile app, in-store). \

**Solution:** \
Amazon ElastiCache (Redis): For real-time inventory caching. \
AWS DynamoDB Streams: To trigger updates in an event-driven model. \
AWS AppSync: To enable real-time GraphQL queries for inventory data. \

**Outcome:** \
Prevents overselling, improves performance, and ensures consistency across platforms.

### 5. Secure and Scalable Payment Processing Gateway
**Use Case:** \ 
Modernize the payment gateway integration for secure, scalable, and compliant transaction handling.

**Scenario:** \
Handle payments from multiple providers (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) while ensuring security and compliance. \
**Solution:** \
AWS API Gateway: To expose payment APIs. \
AWS Lambda: For stateless payment validation and processing logic. \
Amazon S3: To store transaction logs for audit and compliance. \
AWS KMS (Key Management Service): For encrypting sensitive data. \
**Outcome:** \
Ensures payment reliability and security while allowing integration with multiple providers.
